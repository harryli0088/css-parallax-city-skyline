Inspired by and built off of Jeremy Hull's CodePen: https://codepen.io/coderado

I used Boxy SVG Editor to make the mountains and clouds: https://boxy-svg.com/app/

## JS Development

Play around with ```sandbox.html``` and ```sandbox.js``` if you want to programmatically generate SVG. Then you can copy the generated HTML/SVG content into ```index.html``` and remove the script import.
